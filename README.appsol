CGI architectures are vulnerable to code injection through crafted string which exploit the features of the bash command line.

This project makes minimal changes to bash so that process substition, command substition, subshell, and, command line features such as ';', '|', etc. are blocked. 

Only command lines of the form:

<cmd> (options,parameters)* 

are executed.
